# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM
To design, implement, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset into their respective categories, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image recognition tasks.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

For this project, the dataset used is the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains:
Training set: 60,000 grayscale images of size 28×28 pixels.
Test set: 10,000 grayscale images of size 28×28 pixels.
Number of classes: 10
Class labels:
T-shirt/top
Source: The dataset is publicly available through the Keras library and is commonly used for image classification tasks in deep learning.
